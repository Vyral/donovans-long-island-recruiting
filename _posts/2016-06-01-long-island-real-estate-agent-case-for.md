We've probably all seen the mistake of poorly photographed properties listed for sale in Long Island. Did you know that 92% of buyers start their search on the Internet for homes? I have 3 main reasons to use professional photography when selling your Long Island home.

**1. You only get one chance to make a good first impression.**

**2. They take high-quality HD photos with good lighting and a wide-angle lens to show your entire space.** We don't want to deceive people and make the home look bigger than it really is, but you do want things to look attractive, well-lit, and not grainy in your photos.

**3. Once you have the professional quality photographs, you can utilize them in multiple ways.** Your agent can post the photos to Facebook and on numerous websites, as well as virtual tours of your listing.

If you're going to use photos of your home online, it's really a no-brainer whether or not you should use a professional photographer. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'd love to help in any way that I can.
