Travel alert â€” avoid bright, shiny objects!

More and more people are traveling every year, so I thought I'd better issue this travel alert to watch out for bright, shiny objects at the airport. I'm not talking about guns or knives, but rather clothing with metallic features, like the ones on my shirt in the video above.

I actually set off security with this shirt! I thought they'd just take me aside for a moment, but it turned into a full-body search in a private room. I also had to take apart all of my carry-on luggage so they could check for explosives.

My husband and I were able to move on without a mishap from this rural airport, but I can't say the same for the poor French people next to me who were searched. They missed their flight and had to stay overnight in the airport.

So I repeat, don't wear clothing with metallic decorations, and be prepared with extra time in case the unexpected happens!

Likewise, if you're thinking about traveling to a new place to live, I'd love to help you out. Give me a call or send me a text, and let's talk soon. I look forward to hearing from you!
