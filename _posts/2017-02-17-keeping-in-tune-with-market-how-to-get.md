If you’re a homebuyer competing against other offers on the same home, here are three strategies you can use to make your offer stand out.

Today I’m answering a question from Amanda Fabian, who asks, “How do I get my offer accepted when there are four other competing offers on a home?”

First of all, congratulations to Amanda, who will receive a $10 Panera gift card for her question being chosen.

To get your offer accepted when there are other competing offers on the same home, I have three strategies you can use:

**1. Make your offer as competitive as you can without going over your budget.** If you’re going with a higher financing amount, you must be competitive against someone who might be putting more cash into the deal. Also, make sure you have your pre-approval letter and that you submit it at the same time you put your offer in. Your offer must be as strong as possible.

 **2. Find out from the other agent or owner what their hot buttons are.** In other words, does the owner want a quick closing or do they need extra time? When you structure your offer, make sure to add that in. Does the owner have a special appliance they want to take with them? Stress that the appliance can go with the owner and you don’t insist on having it stay.

 **3. Write a personal note from the heart.** This one is my secret weapon. When you do this, find out a little bit about the owner and share with them some information about your family and how you will love the home as much as they did. If you have a cute little kid or puppy, include pictures of them in the note.

If you have a real estate question that’s on your mind, don’t hesitate to email it to me. If I answer it in a future video, you’ll receive a $10 gift card. Until next time, make it a great day!
