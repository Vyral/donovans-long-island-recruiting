Whether you’re 18 or 80 years old, there will be some point where you will sign a document via email. This tool saves a lot of time, especially in the real estate industry.

<div class="post-cta">
<a href="/contact/" target="_blank">Ask us a question</a><br>
<a href="/meeting/" target="_blank">Set up a Skype or coffee meeting</a>
</div>

 It’s incredibly simple. Let’s review a brief demo. First, fill in your personal information. Next, review and act on these documents. You’re already at the point where you need to sign once you read everything over. At the bottom of the page, you sign to agree to the document’s conditions. You can see I’ve already chosen a signature that reflects my own handwriting. Lastly, click finish.

It’s that easy! Now you know how to sign a document electronically, in case you’re ever asked to. If you have any questions about this topic or more, please contact me. I’m available by both phone and email! I look forward to hearing your questions, suggestions for future topics, feedback, and more.
