We’re back again today with another tips, trends, and strategies minute. Today we are talking about the etiquette of group texting. Here in Long Island, everyone with a cell phone is in some kind of group text or another.

There are a lot of nuances to group messaging that you may not even be aware of. You’ve probably gotten a text from a friend before, who also sent the message to other people. Then you quickly reply with a personal message but don’t realize it’s being sent to everyone else, even people you may not know.

We recently had one of our agents tell us they didn’t even know this was possible. They thought when you replied to a group text, you were only replying to the sender. But no, that’s not how group text messaging works. Everyone gets every message unless you do one of two things.

The first thing you can do is look down to the bottom of the message, and uncheck the check mark to simply reply to the person who sent the text. Or better yet, start a new message to the particular person you want to. This way, your messages won’t be broadcast to the entire world.

We just wanted to share this quick tip with you this week because we thought it would be helpful. If you have any questions for us, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you!
