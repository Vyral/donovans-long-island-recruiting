You may have heard that spring and summer are the best times to sell a house, but today, I’m discussing why this winter is a fantastic time to sell your house.

Welcome to my new series, ‘Keeping in Tune With the Market.’ We want to use this series to bring valuable and relevant information to home buyers, sellers, and Realtors alike.

The question we’re answering today comes from Amy Chen who asks, “I thought it was better to sell my house in the spring, but I’ve been told maybe I should consider selling my house in the winter. What do you recommend?’

There are three points I want you to consider about selling your home in the winter:

**1. Prices are at or above what we experienced in 2006.** The only difference is that we haven’t experienced a housing bubble like then. In fact, we have a very steady market. That’s because of…

 **2. Lack of inventory.** This means as a seller, you’re going to be able to receive a higher price for your house due to greater competition among buyers, multiple offers, and interest rates.

 **3. Interest rates are very good right now.** Even though rates have ticked up just a bit, buyers are still out there looking. They will continue to be out looking until rates really start to climb. At that point, they’ll have less buying ability due to paying more for a mortgage.

As you can see, due to high prices, low inventory, and low interest rates, putting a home on the market this winter is a great idea because you never know what’s around the corner. An additional bonus point is that you can even gear your moving date to coincide with the timing you originally wanted.  For example, let's say you found a buyer in the late winter or early spring. You might be able to time your sale in a way that allows you to move in the spring or early summer.

We’d like to thank Amy for the question by sending her a $10 Panera gift card!

If you have a question for me and I answer it in one of my videos, you’ll receive a gift card, too. Just give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
