Today, I'm here with more tips, trends, and strategies to help you have more success in real estate. I recently came across a new, useful invention: Pop Sockets! Pop Sockets are dots that stick to the back of your phone and pop out to create a handle. You can use it to hold your phone and not drop it while calling leads or setting appointments.

<div class="post-cta">
<a href="/contact/" target="_blank">Ask us a question</a><br>
<a href="/meeting/" target="_blank">Set up a Skype or coffee meeting</a>
</div>

You can also use the Pop Socket to prop your phone up on the table. If you're reading an article or long email on your phone, the Pop Socket keeps your phone at an angle for you to read easily and scroll with one hand. Use two Pop Sockets to prop your phone up for videos.

Pop Sockets are easy to remove and re-position on your phone. They usually run about $8, but you can click this link to get $2 off your own Pop Socket.

Remember, if you have any questions, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
